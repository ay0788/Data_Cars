##🚗 Car Price Prediction Project 🚗

Welcome to the Car Price Prediction Project, where data science meets automotive analytics! This project leverages machine learning to predict car prices based on a variety of features, offering valuable insights for potential buyers, sellers, and industry professionals.

##📊 Project Overview
The dataset contains extensive details about cars, including their features, specifications, and market data. By training a machine learning model, we aim to predict the price of a car with high accuracy. This project provides insights into the factors that significantly influence car prices.

##🚀 Features
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove outliers, and normalize data for consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncover insights from data through visualizations and statistical summaries.
Feature Engineering: Enhance the dataset by transforming and selecting relevant features.
Model Training: Utilize advanced machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.
Evaluation Metrics: Analyze model performance using metrics like RMSE, R², and MAE.
